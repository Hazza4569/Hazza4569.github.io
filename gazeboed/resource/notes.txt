- add a close method to each of the canvases. Then can call close on the canvas before setting a new one...
  possibly at the beginning of the SetCanvas method.
- Can have a colour scheme class to use as a return value to set colours without complicating access.
- Possibly create a layout class to store values related to position. Can be used to arrange items on screen
  for a variety of different canvas types.
- Need to make player entry and settings screen(s).
- Can have both a game class and an Instruction class:
   - Game is the prototype for an instruction, and marks positions where random player names will be
   - Can have a folder full of js files, one for each game, which defines the game and all its properties and
     tags and then adds it to an array of games. Can iterate over this array to define which are active dependent
     on the chosen settings
   - Games could have minimum (and maximum ?) numbers of players. Could be handled by a method which is passed the
     current number of players and returns true or false!!
   - An Instruction is created from a game and the player list. Can be inserted into an array (or queue?) which
     stores recent history to enable going backwards.


- Need to work out a way of maintaining same random list for both GetTitle and GetDescription in Game class.
  Probably need to just get both at the same time?
- Maybe optimise by only randomising names needed... don't need to shuffle entire list.
